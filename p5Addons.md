# Add-On Libraries 

p5.js is modular meaning that the developer only need use the p5.js features necessary for his/her project. [p5.js add-on libraries](http://p5js.org/libraries/#using-a-library) contain extra functionality in some cases useful for web development, such as p5.dom, and in other cases more education-oriented, such as p5.bots. 

Add-on libraries must be included in the project directory and linked to in the primary HTML file after p5.js.

```
<head>
  <script src="p5.js">
  <script src="p5.sound.js">
  <script src="sketch.js">
</head>
```

There are two types of libraries: core libraries that are part of the p5 distribution (currently p5.dom and p5.sound) and contributed libraries that are developed, owned, and maintained by members of the p5.js community.
