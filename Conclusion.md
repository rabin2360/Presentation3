### Conclusion:
Like Fred Brooks has pointed out in the article *No Silver Bullet*, there is always a constant push to better the technology that we are using today. In congruence to that pursuit, p5.js has been developed in spite of presence of similar frameworks like Processing.js or D3.js. p5.js has been introduced to make it easier for people with experience in JavaScript but less familiar with frameworks like Processing.js to transition. It has provided people with the ability to manipulate the HTML DOM with a DOM manipulation library. This has given developers or enthusiasts more flexibility to change the HTML elements as they need or want. Similarly, unlike the Processing.js paradigm, p5.js is less resource intensive when not drawing.

At the same time, p5.js is still being developed and expanded today. It does not have the same amount of features as Processing. So the drawing of adopting p5.js in the early stages is lack of full fledged functionality. Like Fred Brooks pointed out in the article, no new technology is without it's shortcomings and pitfalls. It's inevitable to run into the constraints of the new language/system when adopted.
